        So, my top three things in life? Easy:
        <br /> 1. Fiddling around with JavaScript,
        <br />  2. Hitting the road and exploring new spots, and
        <br /> 3. That first cup of coffee in the morning
      </p>

      <p>
        I got hooked on computers with the good ol' Windows 98. Remember the sound of dial-up internet? That was basically my childhood's theme song. Good times.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I’m not glued to the screen, I’m either leveling up in some console game, pumping iron in the gym, getting lost in a good sci-fi book or offering tech support for my mom’s phone. But even during my downtime, part of my brain is always dreaming up cool digital stuff that people would love to use.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another thing about me? I'm that guy who turns to code for even the smallest hitches in life. Forgot someone's birthday one too many times? Yeah, I built a web app for that. It's the joy of tinkering and coming up with nifty digital solutions to those everyday “oops” moments that keeps the dev fire alive in me.
      </p>

      <p>
        But hey, it’s not all about coding. It’s the laughs, the challenges, and those endless debates about the tiniest details. You in?
